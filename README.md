# AMODUS_INJECTOR

Simple injector I put togther from resources on the internet for the [AMODUS-MultiHack-Client](https://github.com/devilb2103/AMODUS-MultiHack-Client)

## instructions
  - place the compiled executable from this project, compiled dll from [here](https://github.com/devilb2103/AMODUS_internal_dll) and the compiled executable from the [AMODUS-MultiHack-Client](https://github.com/devilb2103/AMODUS-MultiHack-Client) into one single folder.
  - add the files or the folder path to your antivirus's white list
  - run "AMODUS MultiHack.exe"
